# Stringer - Front-End Tracking Library for Mayvenn
## Setup
- Prerequisites: Have node and npm installed  
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`

## Usage
Use a snippet similar to the one found in index.html to bring in stringer and the method stubs to support async load. When the API settles down a bit, we'll include a minified snippet here that includes a version of stringer that's on the CDN that can be directly copied into apps.
