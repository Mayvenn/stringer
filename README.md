# stringer
WIP
[x] push implementation
  [x] UUID generation (refer to node code)  
      currently the library expects us to use a script tag  
  [x] send event to a fake server with the event  
  [x] insert UUID generation code into our stringer function  

[x] init callback  
  [x] get server url from config  
  [x] processes all events in the array first (backfilling)
